## :space_invader: SQL Skills Showcase

This project demonstrates various SQL techniques, including:

- **Aggregation Functions**: `SUM()`, `MAX()` for total cases and deaths.
- **Filtering Data**: Using `WHERE` to analyze specific regions or time frames.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: `GROUP BY` for country-wise and date-wise analysis.
- **Sorting Data**: `ORDER BY` to rank countries by infection or death rates.
- **Type Conversion**: `CAST()` for percentage calculations.
- **Calculated Fields**: Computing survival and fatality rates using SQL expressions.

## :floppy_disk: Database Details

- **Database System**: Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)
- **Main Table**: `CovidDeaths$`
- **Table Structure**: Flat table without explicit foreign keys, but can be linked to vaccination datasets.
- **Complex Queries**: Includes calculations, filtering, grouping, and ordering to derive meaningful insights.

## :dart: Features & Functionality

- Identifies countries with the highest infection and death rates.
- Calculates global and daily COVID-19 statistics.
- Displays survival rates.

---

## :gear: Technical Stack

- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)
- **Tools Used**: SQL queries for analysis, potential integration with Power BI or Python for visualization.

## :computer: Sample Queries

```sql
-- Total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Worldwide
SELECT 
    SUM(total_cases) AS Global_Cases, 
    SUM(total_deaths) AS Global_Deaths, 
    (SUM(total_deaths) * 100.0 / NULLIF(SUM(total_cases), 0)) AS Global_Fatality_Rate
FROM CovidDeaths$;
```

```sql
-- Top 5 Countries by Total Cases
SELECT TOP 5 
    location, 
    SUM(total_cases) AS Total_Cases
FROM CovidDeaths$
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY Total_Cases DESC;
```

```sql
-- Daily New Cases and Deaths
SELECT 
    date, 
    location, 
    new_cases, 
    new_deaths
FROM CovidDeaths$
WHERE location = 'United States'
ORDER BY date;
```
